/**
 * A Transactional Reference comparable to the <a href="http://clojure.org/refs">Clojure Ref</a>.
 * If a method is prefixed with atomic, the call will always run under its own txn, no
 * matter if there already is a txn available (so the propagation level is {@link PropagationLevel#RequiresNew}).
 * For the other methods, always an txn needs to be available, else you will get the
 * {@link org.multiverse.api.exceptions.TxnMandatoryException}.
 *
 * <h3>ControlFlowError</h3>
 *
 * <p>All non atomic methods are able to throw a (subclass) of the {@link org.multiverse.api.exceptions.ControlFlowError}. This error should
 * not be caught, it is task of the {@link TxnExecutor} to deal with.
 * 
 * <h3>TransactionExecutionException</h3>
 *
 * <p>Most of the methods can throw a {@link org.multiverse.api.exceptions.TxnExecutionException}.
 * This exception can be caught, but in most cases you want to figure out what the cause is (e.g. because
 * there are too many retries) and solve that problem.
 *
 * <h3>Threadsafe</h3>
 *
 * <p>All methods are threadsafe.
