<h1>Multiverse 0.3</h1>

Multiverse 0.3 was released at 19 December 2009 afer more than a year of hard working (read almost
every bit of spare time I had). This is a list of the most important features of the 0.3 release:
<ol>
    <li>
        Basic instrumentation so that normal POJO's are able to participate in the
        Multiverse. This can be done through the @TransactionalObject and
        @TransactionalMethod annotation, without being forced to extend from some
        basic class and cripple the design or to introduce awkward code to access
        fields of transactional objects.
    </li>
    <li>
        Non tracking readonly transaction: causes less stress on the transaction, so
        much cheaper than an update transaction. But it isn't allowed to participate
        in blocking operations and it also is more subject to read conflicts.
    </li>
    <li>
        Optimization for final fields of TransactionalObjects. Final fields are
        completely ignored by Multiverse, so there is no overhead on using as many as
        final fields as possible. If an object
    </li>
    <li>
        Retry: one of the basic thread notifcation constructs that make it possible to
        create transactional blocking operations like a BlockingQueue.put.
    </li>
    <li>
        OrElse: one of the basic thread notification constructs that make it possible
        to try an alternative path of a blocking operation fails.
    </li>
    <li>
        TransactionTemplate: a Template method implementation that can be used to
        create an transactional executed piece of code. The advantage of using a
        TransactionTemplate is that it provides the same transaction management
        logic the bytecode-instrumentation provides.
    </li>
    <li>
        TransactionalLinkedList: a general purpose transactional LinkedList that can be used
        as:
        <ul>
            <li>java.util.Queue</li>
            <li>java.util.Deque</li>
            <li>java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue</li>
            <li>java.util.concurrent.BlockingDeque</li>
            <li>java.util.List</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        TransactionalRef: a transactional reference to Objects. Can be seen as the
        transactional version of the java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicRef. There also
        is an TransactionalRef implementation available that doesn't rely on a Java agent.
        The Akka project from Jonas Boner is an in Scala written distributed actors system
        that makes use of this functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        STM framework: At the moment Multiverse contains a single STM implementation
        called the AlphaStm which is a general purpose stm implementation. But it certainly
        is possible to create your own stm implementation and reuse as much as the Multiverse
        components as needed with having the option to build eveything yourself.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transaction lifecycle tasks: to make it possible to execute logic just before or after
        aborts and commits. This is useful to start or clean up non transactional resources.
    </li>
    <li>
        Basic Scala integration.
    </li>
    <li>
        The possibility to exclude fields from being transactional using the @Exclude annotation.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Known limitations</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Java agent has no support for a transactional object subclassing.</li>
    <li>The TransactionalLinkedList is very non concurrent because it causes a lot of conflicts
        on its internal fields (like the head/tail/size). This means that takes and puts can't
        execute concurrent and that takes can't happen concurrent and the same goes for takes.
        This will be solved in the future (perhaps using Transactional Boosting).
    </li>
    <li>
        No protection against the writeskew problem; an isolation problem. This will be solved
        in Multiverse 0.4
    </li>
</ol>
