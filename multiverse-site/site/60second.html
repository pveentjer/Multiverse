<h1>60 Second guide to Multiverse</h1>

Multiverse is a Software Transansactional Memory implementation and meant as an alternative to traditional lock
based concurrency. If you have worked with databases before, Transactional Memory should feel familiar because
both share one very important concept: txns.
<p>
    In Multiverse a normal POJO can be made transactional by adding the <tt>TransactionalObject</tt> annotation, e.g.:
<pre>

    import org.multiverse.api.*;
    import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.*;

    public class Account{

        private Ref&lt;Date&gt; lastUpdate = newTxnRef();
        private IntRef balance = newTxnInteger();

        public Account(int balance){
            setBalance(balance);
        }

        public int getLastUpdate(){
            return lastUpdate;
        }

        public int getBalance(){
            return balance;
        }

        public void setBalance(int newBalance){
            lastUpdate = new Date();
    
            if(newBalance &lt; 0){
                throw new IllegalStateException("negative balance not allowed");
            }
            balance = newBalance;
        }
    }
</pre>
All <b>instance</b> methods of this Account class will now be transactional and give you the following features:
<ol>
    <li><b>failure atomicity:</b> all writes will commit or none will commit. For an example check the
        setBalance method where the lastUpdate is set even though the call could fail.
    </li>
    <li><b>isolation: </b> all reads and writes are thread-safe and are isolated from
        other txns. A txn automatically gets a Oracle version of the SERIALIZABLE isolation level.
        You don't need to deal with lower isolation levels like READ_UNCOMMITTED, READ_COMMITTED or
        REPEATABLE_READ.
    </li>
    <li><b>no deadlocks</b> between txns because deadlocks are prevented by Multiverse.
</ol>
Another big advantage is that the methods have become composable, so you can combine methods while keeping the
transactional properties. This is very hard to realize with a traditional lock based approach. Composing can be
done by creating a new instance method on a transactional object that calls the composing operations, or
by adding a <tt>TransactionalMethod</tt> annotation around a normal method of a non transactional object, or around a
static method of a transactional object, e.g.:

<pre>
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalMethod;
    import org.multiverse.annotations.TransactionalObject;

    @TransactionalObject
    public class Account{

        ...

        @TransactionalMethod
        public static void transfer(Account from, Account to, int amount){
            from.setBalance(from.getBalance()-amount);
            to.setBalance(to.getBalance()+amount);
        }
    }
</pre>
Money can safely be transferred from one account to another using the
<tt>transfer</tt> method: no race problems, partial
writes or deadlocks are possible.
<p/>
These examples only scratch the surface of Multiverse, but just having transactional methods can be
a very big step forward in a lot of cases. For more advanced features and in-depth documention, the
