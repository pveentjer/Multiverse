The new BetaStm that was introduced in Multiverse 0.7, does not longer rely on a shared clock. TL2/MVCC based STM's
rely on a shared clock (atomic lock) which needs to be updated by updating threads even though they don't
share any other state. There are some optimizations that can be applied to reduce contention, but in the long
run I think it is better to remove the clock altogether. As you can see in the graph, the STM's scale linearly
as long as there is no contention.
