     With traditional concurrency control, one can write blocking structures (so structures where a thread waits until some condition changes) based on primitive
    synchronization structures like the waitset/java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition. Or using some higher blocking primitives like the java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch
    or java.util.concurrent.Future. With Stm it also is possible to write blocking datastructures using the retry primitive.

        The following example shows a Counter, where a thread can block until the counter has reached some value.
    <programlisting language="java">

       import org.multiverse.api.*;
       import org.multiverse.api.refs.*;
       import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.*;

       public class Counter{
           private final IntRef value = newIntRef(0);

           public void increment(){
                execute(new AtomicVoidClosure()){
                   public void execute(Transaction tx){
                       value.increment(1);
                   }
               });
           }

           public void await(final int expected){
               execute(new AtomicVoidClosure()){
                   public void execute(Transaction tx){
                       if(value.get()&lt;expected){
                           retry();
                       }
                   }
               });
           }

           ...
       }
       </programlisting>
       In this example, when a transaction executed the await and finds that the value has not reached the expected value, the transaction will block until
       the value become equal or larger to the expected value.
</para>
    <para>
        For explanation purposes, the code is more elaborate than strictly needed. The IntRef has different methods for waiting on certain values and the
        Counter.increment could be simplified by calling an IntRef.atomicIncrement().
    </para>

    <title>RetryError</title>
    <para>
        The blocking functionality works like this: when a retry is called, the transaction will register a listener on all reads it has executed, aborts
        the transaction and throws a org.multiverse.api.exceptions.RetryError (an instance of the org.multiverse.api.exceptions.ControlFlowError). This Error
        should only be caught by the AtomicBlock and till it is caught, it unwinds the callstack. When it is caught by the AtomicBlock, the RetryLatch.await
        that was registered on all reads references, will be called and the transaction is going to block. So do not catch this Error unless you really know
        what you are doing.

    <title>Blocking on multiple resources</title>
    <para>
          With traditional concurrency contol, it is hard to make it possible on multiple datastructures. If yuo have 2 BlockingQueues
        for example, it is hard for a thread to wait for an element to be placed on either one of them. Luckily this problem is solved
        when STM is used. Example:
        <programlisting language="java">
    public class Foo{
        private final Counter counter1 = new Counter();
        private final Counter counter2 = new Counter();

        public void awaitBoth(final int value){
            execute(new AtomicVoidClosure()){
                public void execute(Transaction tx){
                    if(counter1.get()&gt;=value &amp;&amp; counter2.get()&gt;value){
                        return;
                    }

                    retry();
                }
            });
        }

        ...
    }
        This example show hows to wait until both counters have reached some value. A transaction will automatically block on all references
        it has read.

    <title>Prevent blocking</title>
    <para>
        The default setting for a transaction, is that it is allowed to block. If you don't want a transaction to be able to block, the
        TransactionFactoryBuilder.setBlockingAllowed can be called.
    <programlisting language="java">

    import org.multiverse.api.*;
    import org.multiverse.api.refs.*;
    import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.*;

    public class Counter{
        private final static AtomicBlock awaitBlock = getGlobalStmInstance()
                 .newTransactionFactoryBuilder()
                 .setBlockingAllowed(false)
                 .newAtomicBlock();

        private final IntRef value = newIntRef(0);

        public void await(final int a){
            awaitBlock.execute(new AtomicVoidClosure()){
                public void execute(Transaction tx){
                    if(value.get()&lt;a){
                        retry();
                    }
                }
            });
        }

        ...
    }
    </programlisting>
    When the await method is called, and the amount is not sufficient, a retry is executed. But instead of blocking, a org.multiverse.api.exceptions.RetryNotAllowedException
    is thrown.
    </para>

    <title>Timeout</title>
    <para>
        The default is that unbound waiting is used. But in some cases you want to configure how long a transaction is allowed to block
        before throwing a org.multiverse.api.exceptions.RetryTimeoutException. This can be done through the TransactionFactoryBuilder.setTimeoutNs
        method. Atm no support is provided to configure this on a lower level.
    <programlisting language="java">

    import org.multiverse.api.*;
    import org.multiverse.api.refs.*;
    import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.*;

    public class Counter{
        private final static AtomicBlock awaitBlock = getGlobalStmInstance()
                 .newTransactionFactoryBuilder()
                 .setTimeoutNs(TimeUnit.SECONDS.toNanos(10))
                 .newAtomicBlock();

        private final IntRef value = newIntRef(0);

        public void await(final int a){
            awaitBlock.execute(new AtomicVoidClosure()){
                public void execute(Transaction tx){
                    if(value.get()&lt;a){
                        retry();
                    }
                }
            });
        }

        ...
    }
    </programlisting>
    </para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
    <title>Interruptibility</title>
    <para>
          The default is that a transaction is not interruptible. But in some cases you want a transaction to be interruptible. This can be done using the
          setInterruptible method on the org.multiverse.api.TransactionFactoryBuilder.
    <programlisting language="java">

    import org.multiverse.api.*;
    import org.multiverse.api.refs.*;
    import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.*;

    public class Counter{
        private final static AtomicBlock awaitBlock = getGlobalStmInstance()
                 .newTransactionFactoryBuilder()
                 .setInterruptible(true)
                 .newAtomicBlock();

        private final IntRef value = newIntRef(0);

        public void await(final int a){
            awaitBlock.execute(new AtomicVoidClosure()){
                public void execute(Transaction tx){
                    if(value.get()&lt;a){
                        retry();
                    }
                }
            });
        }

        ...
    }
    </programlisting>
    If a thread blocks on the retry, it can be interrupted by a nother thread. Instead of the java.lang.InterruptedException is thrown, the
        org.multiverse.api.exceptions.RetryInterruptedException is thrown which is unchecked.
